  <h1>💌 To the One Who Changed My World❤️</h1>
  <p>Before you came into my life, I never knew what it meant to smile for no reason...
  Your presence turned ordinary days into magical ones. Each moment with you has painted my life in colors I never imagined. You've been my light in the darkest times, and my joy in the brightest.
  You walked into my world so effortlessly, and yet, everything changed. The way you laugh, the way you speak, the way your eyes light up when you're passionate about something—every detail of you became my favorite story to observe.
  I used to believe love was just a fairytale—something seen in movies or read in books. But then you came, and suddenly, love had a voice, a heartbeat, a smile... your smile.
  Now, every sunrise feels warmer, every star seems to shine for us, and every heartbeat whispers your name. You’re not just part of my story—you are the story.</p>

  <h2>Memories We Made🤌</h2>
  <ul class="timeline">
    <li>Our first chat... I still remember every word and how my heart raced.
    😊 That silly laugh of yours I adore more than any song in the world.
    📱 Waiting for your texts and rereading them like they were poetry written just for me.
    🤝 When we supported each other through tough days, I knew we had something rare.
    🌙 That night we talked for hours, forgetting time, lost in each other’s worlds.
    💖 Realizing I don't want anyone else but you. You complete me in ways I never thought possible.
    🎨 Dreaming together—of places we’ll go, things we’ll build, and the life we hope to share.
    🎉 Our inside jokes, shared secrets, and late-night talks are treasures I hold close.
    💑 That moment I saw your name and my entire mood changed—that's when I knew it was love.
    📝 Writing your name in the corners of my mind and heart like it belongs there forever.</li>

    <h2>🌹A Letter with full of LOVE🫶</h2>
    <div class="letter">
     <p>
  My dearest love ❤️,<br/><br/>
  Every moment spent with you is a treasure I keep close to my heart. The warmth of your voice, the sparkle in your eyes, and the calm in your presence have become my favorite parts of every day.
  When you're near, time feels kinder, and the world seems to pause — just to let us exist in our own quiet universe. When you're away, I count heartbeats, not minutes, longing for the comfort of your smile.
  You make me better — not by changing who I am, but by loving every imperfect piece of me. You inspire me to dream bolder, love deeper, and live more fully. In you, I've found not just love, but home.

  I adore your mind — so brilliant and kind. I adore your heart — full of empathy, laughter, and light. And I adore your soul — the beautiful, rare thing that found its way to mine across time and chance.

  You are the love I never saw coming, but the one my soul recognized the moment we met. You are the wish I whispered to the stars, answered in the form of you.<br/><br/>

  WILL YOU BE MINE!!.... forever?<br/><br/>

  Yours eternally and endlessly,<br/>
  💖
